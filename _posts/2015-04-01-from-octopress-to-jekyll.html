After 4 months' idleness, I've come back to my blog and decide to take another
look at the blogging tools.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">What do I need for blogging tools?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
As a developer using Emacs, I've taken the following as prerequisites:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Blog source in <code>org-mode</code> format.
</li>
<li><code>Github Page</code> or similar static blog hosting sites (e.g. <code>Heroku</code>).
</li>
</ol>

<p>
And what actually makes a blog site?
</p>
<pre class="example">
Articles linked in a website-way: uniform theme, front page, navigator, catogories and etc.
</pre>
<p>
So naturally a static site generator would be sufficient. For the record, one
year ago I used my own self-hosted <code>wordpress</code>, which is easier to use but as a
developer I found I know too little and it was an overkill solution for a blog.
</p>

<p>
About choosing the right static site generator, I've found <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a>, which is a
ranking site to static site generators as <a href="http://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch.com</a> to <code>Linux/BSD</code>
distributions. I was using <i>Octopress</i>. Two potential candidates are <i>Jekyll</i>, which
is what's used by <code>Github Page</code> and <i>Hexo</i>, ranked as the third, a <code>nodejs</code> based
generator that seems to be compatible with <code>Octopress</code>. I'm interested in <code>Hexo</code>
as recently I've started a project using <code>nodejs-webkit</code>, another story.
</p>

<p>
Other successful stories on <code>org-mode</code>-related blogs have suggested: <a href="http://www.blogofile.com/">Blogofile</a>,
<i>Pelican</i> and <i>Nikola</i>.

<h2 id="sec-2">Octopress/Rails is NOT KISS.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
This site was using <code>Octopress</code> and some of my posts here are about configuring
<code>Octopress</code>. <code>Octopress</code> is not hard to use. As a complete beginner, it took me
about two days to setup up the blog (with <a href="https://github.com/yoshinari-nomura/org-octopress">Org-octopress</a>), and by the third I was
able to play with the source to add some small new features. The issue with
<code>Octopress</code> is that it feels like <code>Rails</code>: convenient, powerful and
highly-customizable, but as a newbie the learning curve is steep. I don't feel I
understand the structure at all and lost in features&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
So maybe another time for <code>Octopress</code>. To learn more, I decided to go with the
old <code>KISS</code>: use simple/single-purpose tools and chain them together.

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3">Notes on the migration.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The choice is <code>Jekyll</code>, which <code>Octopress</code> claims to base on. <a href="http://www.academia.edu/9761706/Building_a_Technical_Blog_Site_With_Jekyll_And_Emacs">This article</a> is
very helpful in making this decision. The breakdown steps in that article help
me understand the missing pieces from <code>Org</code> files to <code>Jekyll</code> site:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><code>Jekyll</code> handles <code>Markdown</code> natively, but it also can deal with HTML with
special headers (<code>YAML</code> <code>Jekyll</code> header).
</li>
<li><code>Org-publish</code> export org files to HTML format.
</li>
<li>Insert the required header to the exported HTML files and put the result
files in <code>Jekyll</code> directory. It's DONE!
</li>
</ol>

<p>
And it turns out there are many Emacs packages deal with these steps. I choose
<a href="https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll">org2jekyll</a> for its simplicity and separation of <code>Org</code> header and <code>Jekyll</code>
header.
</p>

<p>
An afternoon is all it takes to finish the migration. Yep, I lose some features
like comments, tag cloud and etc, but I also understand the insides much
clearer. I plan to add back features step by step with more confidence!

<h2 id="sec-4">More to desire.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
<code>org2jekyll</code> is the bridge between <code>Org</code> and <code>Jekyll</code>. There are some issues I'd
like to see fixed and features to be implemented. Now I can focus on "simple"
components like <code>Jekyll</code>, <code>org2jekyll</code> and <code>org-publish</code>. This kind of clarity
and confidence didn't come out from many weeks working with <code>Org</code> and
<code>Org-octopress</code>: too many levels of abstractions impede understanding. Maybe
some day I'll be back to <code>Octopress</code> for its strength, but surely after I've
learned more with the KISS ^_^
