I read often, these "Readings: XXX" series are my note recordings. As an English learner, some notes appeal to me for their mere language values and might not be related to the content of the book ;P.

> ... the Dome -- before City Earth.


> A pairs of brass-rimmed goggles with darkened lenses appeared in the gap. They gave the fragile girl wearing them the countenance of a nervous lemur.


> ... so -- the words escaped him.


> ... the electric motors whined up to speed.


> "... I don't think this Jasper is the wet-behind-ears kid you think he is. That dude's got some serious game face. He knows what's going down."


> Ahead of him bright light reduced his pupils to dues specks.


> ... her slow veins showed through like blue string.


> Beth blushes further, turning her face away with all **the subtle coyness of a vixen in heat**. **Twirling a length of auburn hair around** her perfectly manicured finger, she bites her lip.


> Petal smiled and shook her head. "You just like her bouncing tits."

> "What? No! That's not what I--"

> "Chill, Gez, I'm just **yanking your chain**."

> "... a number of buildings appeared on the horizon: skyscrapers and many others in all kinds of sizes and shapes stood in the fog like grey fungi."


> Sitting made **a bright flare explode** in his vision.


> He stood and waited for **his balance to re-calibrate**.


> ... rippling with muscles beneath his dark form-fitting clothes, ...


> "... I'll **patch in**."


> He admonished himself for being so neglectful.


> The heat of the shot boiled the blood so that a red mist fell upon the slumped body.


> AO -- augmented overlay.


> Jachz blinked once and became still; so still that Gerry had a strange idea he might have perhaps crashed and was in need of a reboot.


> "I can't answer that, as I know not what I miss. One cannot wish for something one does not know or understand."
