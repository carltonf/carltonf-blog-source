It's highly recommended to use *ratpoison* or *stumpwm*. However, the following
should work on any desktop environment (e.g. Gnome and KDE)

* Tools
- =xwrits= - reminds you to take wrist breaks

  well, in case you don't have *workrave* or *RSIBreak*

  *Update:* Recent years, I've used a Android app [[https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter%3Dbodhi&fdid%3Dorg.yuttadhammo.BodhiTimer][BodhiTimer]] to keep track the
  time. It's simple, elegant and open source.

- =xbindkeys= - a key-grabbing program for X

  can be used to define combination keys that simulate behaviors of *ratpoison*

- =dmenu= - dynamic menu (includes dmenu_run, and dmenu_path)

  open program through keystrokes

- =xmodmap= - utility for modifying keymaps and pointer button mappings in X

  Emacs key (make enter and cap ctrls)

* Some old Configurations

[[https://github.com/carltonf/configurations/tree/master/keyoriented][Old and not used for a while]] (kept as a reference)

*NOTE*: GNU =Guile= is required to configure =xbindkeys= for more advanced
features.
