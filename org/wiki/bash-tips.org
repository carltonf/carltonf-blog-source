* Remove Some Files But Not All

** Shell Pattern (=glob= and =extglob=)

*** Basic Glob

=?=: one char; =*=: any number of chars; =[..]=: one of the char

*REMARK*: Very limited, trying to figure out the right pattern might be even
harder and more time consuming than the toolchain method (see below).

*** =extglob=

Need to turn on this feature: =shopt -s extglob=.

=!(.|.|.)=: anything that doesn't match patterns


** Use extra tools

One example: =ls | grep ... | xargs rm=
