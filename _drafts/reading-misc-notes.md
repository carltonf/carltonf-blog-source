A post on books that I've not finished. I stop reading these books for various reasons, but yet I still make some notes along the way.

Red Rising
==========

**Comments**: I stopped reading it at 12%. It's a very well written book but I dislike this type of story in general: a strict hierarchical society, a contrived hero who is made to suffer so he can rise up to rebel against the system, and the whole system is dumb in the front of the hero's actions. This scheme just doesn't appeal to me as a futuristic story, much as what I feel about another [series](http://www.amazon.com/Singularity-Heretic-Thriller-ebook/dp/B00PQT7XT6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1457079221&sr=8-1&keywords=heretic+singularity). I mean dystopia may exist in the future, but if it's going to be a pervasive and powerful society as proclaimed by these stories, then it must have its strength and it's not something that a single (group) heroes can take down out of pure ideology or revenge. Seriously, on the story level, it's no better than Chinese amateur web stories.

Anyway, it's still a well written book so I have some notes to put down.

> ... it feels like I'm swaddled in a heavy quilt of hot piss.


> Old enough to screw, old enough to crew.


> She said she knew we'd marry since we were children. I didn't.


> Barlow laughs, voice crackling with static. (over radios)


> "She is a pretty little thing. Drill into that pocket and leave her to me. Old and fat I be, but my drill still digs a dent."


> "blisters have not yet become calluses."


> Those drills will melt your bones if you're not careful. And I'm not careful. Just nimble.

A very clever way to describe the super talents of our hero.


> Most men panic when they get caught, and so the slingBlade is a nasty halfmoon weapon meant to be used by clumsy hands.


> I miss those days, days when I was young enough that I didn't judge him for the stink of swill on his breath.

The same sensation shared while we're looking at our elders.


> ... usually replies by taking a swig and saying, "Rather a drink be my master than a man. These chains taste sweet."


> my father died for something, while Uncle Narol lived and drank and squandered his life.


> But her smiles are more like grimaces. ... She gives me that half smile, as if she knows something I do not.


> Yet despite the disappointment, some part of us doesn't blame the Society. We blame Gamma, who receives the gifts. A man's only got so much hate, I suppose.


> "Death isn't empty like you say it is."


> "You have been given so, so much, but you set your sights so low." ... There\'s a long ,terrible silence that stretches between us.
