Org Source Files for Personal Blog
==================================

**DEPRECIATED**

This repo holds source files in `org` format for [my personal blog](http://carltonf.github.io/).

As part of my "[Adaptationism](http://carltonf.github.io/adapt-vs-configure)" change, I've switched from `org` + [org2jekyll](https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll) to `Markdown` directly. Since the `Github Page` supports rendering `Markdown` file directly, there is thus no need for a separate source repo.
