In my workplace, sometimes <code>offlineimap</code> fails to retrieve mails from the
company mail sever sometimes.
</p>

<p>
we have the following error:

<p>
This following steps are a way to "fix" this, or more precisely a workaround.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The "Copy" lines before errors identify the possible error message.
</li>

<li>Find the last successfully archived mail

<p>
In the case above, 13095 and 13096 are the suspicious mails ID. Search the
local <code>offlineimap</code> mailbox for these two IDs. If you can't find it, use
13094, i.e. an even earlier one. After all, with an error close, the writing
operation might simply fail.
</p>
</li>

<li>Find another way to log into your mail account.

<p>
Web UI, another Web clients and etc.
</p>
</li>

<li>Locate the mail you find in step 2.

<p>
Sort all your mail from latest to oldest. And look at the source of the mail
in step 2, use "Date" to locate it. Pay attention to the time zone setting.
Let's denote the mail you found "2R".
</p>
</li>

<li>Remove one or more later mail(s) after "2R".

<p>
This would usually solve the problem. Later on, we might try to find out
what's wrong with the "bad" mails.
